<h2>My plans after graduation!</h2>
	<p>
	After I graduate, <i> hopefully </i> , I plan to get a job in either consulting or for a startup company. 
	If all goes to plan I would love to be able to get back home to <strong> California </strong>, seeing as that I truly have not lived there 
	in over 3 years. After my internship last summer at a <strong> VC firm </strong>, I realized how exciting the world of new technology and 
	developments can be. Working at a place where I can use my <em> problem solving skills as well as love for technology </em> would be ideal.
